Semester Long Project

This is a Pacman style, level-based educational game. Initially, the player will start as a Freshman in Wright Hall (or
some other freshmen dorm). They will be picking up pizzaritas (point coins) and RA tickets in a level. When the level
begins, there will be RAs wandering around the map and whenever you pick up a RA ticket, there will be a Clark-based
question pop up on the screen (the game will pause for the time being) and a random question related to the building/level
will show up. It will give the player 5 seconds to solve a multiple choice question. If the player gets it right, they
will get a 1.1 times score bonus and RA will pause for a few seconds and the player will be invincible during that time.
Once the player passes a level, they will have accumulated some points and they will be able to move on to the next level
/building. If they have enough points, they will be promoted to a Sophomore, and so on.

Through this game, we will depict student life at Clark in an educational manner, so that students gain knowledge about
Clark while playing this game.It will be a score based game and the scores will be posted online, in a global leaderboard.
People will also be able to filter the leaderboard by class level and dorms, to have a better competition with their
friends.
